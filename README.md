## Project Description

In the role of a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, a fictional organization, the assigned research project focuses on employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The primary objective is to develop a structured approach for analyzing employee data contained in six CSV files. This involves designing tables for effective data representation, importing the data into a SQL database, and executing a comprehensive process involving data modeling, engineering, and analysis.

The central aim of this project is to derive pertinent insights from the historical employee database. This includes identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, facilitating a thorough understanding of Pewlett Hackard's workforce during the specified time periods.

The execution of this project relies on leveraging proficiency in data engineering and SQL to establish an efficient database structure, seamlessly import data, and formulate queries that extract pertinent information. The ultimate goal is to present actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making within Pewlett Hackard based on the historical data at hand.
